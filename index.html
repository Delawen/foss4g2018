		i'm going to talk specifically from my point of view and experience, I begin participating in communities in 2012, when I joined Geoinquietos Argentina and even today we are just 66 member, not all of those are active, 12 are women. But in terms of real participation,  I can count them with the fingers of one hand.

	<aside class="notes">
		we think that the inclusion of diverse identities, but in particular women, because that what we are in communities is not only what makes them rich and allows them to grow, but also what generates more inclusion so you go from the benefits of the whole, to the benefits to the individuals, it makes us grow and flourish

		I got to lead and coordinate the local version of foss4g last year, and WOW!. It was a lot of work, a lot of fun, very fulfilling, but also very difficult. There where many situations that got me thinking if the problems that arose were because of my actions or because I was a woman, a minority. And it’s not only I who sees this. Many women realizing more and more the micromachism that rule our environment

			but there is light at the end of the tunnel, the shining star in this situations are the people who, when discovering themselves uncomfortable in this scenarios, got together and formed, for instance, women only groups (like Geochicas o Las de Sistemas) to be able to participate, train, get support. that’s when I learned a very very magic word: sorority. It means a lot to be able to talk to others in a community and always feel like an equal, not get explained what you know, because even tho a community is not there to be emotional support for you, sometimes it helps a lot to know there are other people out there that are going through the same things you are. But ultimately the support you get from this communities builds you up and encourages you to be a part of something bigger, to not quit, to stand by your chosen profession, even if it’s in an environment that's hostile and you will always be a minority, you deserve to be there, and when you are there, maybe some others will be tempted to join you.
